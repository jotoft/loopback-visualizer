# TODO List

## Current Focus - Multi-Template Phase Lock System

### Phase 1: Dual Template Proof of Concept (In Progress)
- [ ] **Implement MultiTemplateAnalyzer class** - Manage multiple phase lock analyzers
  - [ ] Support for 2 concurrent templates with different filter configs
  - [ ] Independent correlation tracking per template
  - [ ] Configurable frequency bands (e.g., bass 20-200Hz, mids 200-4kHz)
  
- [ ] **Template Blending & Visualization**
  - [ ] Alpha blending based on correlation strength
  - [ ] Color assignment per template (e.g., red for bass, cyan for mids)
  - [ ] Smooth fade in/out when correlation is gained/lost
  - [ ] Shared ghost trail buffer across templates

- [ ] **Dynamic Responsiveness**
  - [ ] Multiple EMA filters per band with different time constants
  - [ ] Fade speed proportional to EMA responsiveness (slow filter = slow fade)
  - [ ] Visual indication of which template is "dominant"

### Phase 2: Enhanced Multi-Template Features
- [ ] **Spectral Layer Visualization**
  - [ ] Vertical separation of frequency bands
  - [ ] Option to view templates separately or combined
  - [ ] Spectral "heat map" showing which frequencies are locked

- [ ] **Adaptive Template Management**
  - [ ] Automatic template creation based on spectral content
  - [ ] Template "competition" - strongest correlation wins display priority
  - [ ] Template morphing for smooth transitions

- [ ] **Advanced Ghost Trails**
  - [ ] Per-template trail colors
  - [ ] Trail intensity based on historical correlation strength
  - [ ] "Harmonic trails" showing frequency relationships
